# ngAuto
Simple yet powerful project based on Ngrok technology. Launching ngAuto.jar will start SSL tunneling, which streams your current localhost project to randomly generated url. The url is subsequently copied to your clipboard, so you can easily visit it. Generated url can also be retrieved from web API, which also offers uniform endpoint for your latest stream redirection.
